  # This rule is fine, but at the time of writing we're working on enforcing the linter,
  # and it is simply producing too many errors to handle manually. I've decided to disable
  # it for now, since it doesn't really improve code quality in such a meaningful way. Feel free
  # to re-enable at some point in the future if it is warranted.
  # TODO: consider re-enabling this rule as per the previous comments.
